About This Repository
This repository contains a small sample of the scripting and automation work I have done over the past ten years. Nothing here is polished or rewritten for show. These are real tools, used in real environments, and sanitized as best as possible for the people and companies they were originally created for.
The scripts represent different parts of my work across platforms:

Cross‑Platform Automation
• 	iDRAC DNS and NTP configuration
Automates multi‑site DNS and NTP settings across Dell iDRAC hardware using RACADM and Active Directory lookups.

Windows Infrastructure
• 	DFS namespace and replication setup
Builds DFS folders, installs DFSR, creates replication groups, and links everything together for multi‑site deployments.

Co‑Authored with AI
• 	Fireflies cleanup and removal
A collaborative script built with AI assistance to remove leftover SaaS artifacts from Outlook, Teams, and Windows.

Desktop and Workstation Maintenance
• 	RemoveBloat
A cleanup script for removing unnecessary applications and restoring predictable workstation behavior.

These scripts show an evolution in style, structure, and approach over nearly a decade. Some are older, some are newer, and all of them reflect real operational needs at the time they were written.
If you find something useful here, great. If you see the progression, even better.
